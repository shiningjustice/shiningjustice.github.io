          <h3>Quiz App: A Quiz for My Parents</h3>
          <p>This quiz app was a made with Badri Narayana, prompted by an assignment in my bootcamp. Most people make quiz apps about fun trivia but I like to rock the boat a bit. I believe that fun is one of the best ways to learn, and since my parents only had a fuzzy idea of what I was doing with my life, I wanted to make this for and because of them; a way to start off a new career with love to the people that love me a lot.</p>

        <h3>tl;dr</h3>
        <p>I’ve always been creative and liked problem-solving, but wasn’t able to see myself working with technology for a while. Over time I’ve seen the overlap in my abilities and interests with coding and finally took the plunge. After a Bachelor’s in Linguistics and 2.5 years in administration and operations, I’m here to take my shot.</p>
        <h3>Longer Story</h3>
        <p>I never thought I would be in computers. I wasn’t single-minded enough for that. Sure, I was focused and had an engineer-y mind, but had too many interests. As a creative I liked figuring out the inner-workings of the world but lacked direction. While I appreciated the practicality of technology (I was unofficially my family’s support person), I hated how consuming it was for the majority of my world. Also, I thought software was uninteresting because looking at binary all day seemed boring (yeah, I thought only binary was used… I was a smart kid).</p>
        <p>Fast-forward into adulthood, when things get nuanced and when what I considered black or white, with my more developed eyes, often turned out to be more gray. And also, suddenly money is something I need to survive and not just a concept I can scoff at (save your laughs for later, folks). What could I do that I could enjoy and thrive in? While I wasn’t in a terrible place career-wise, I wanted to grow to my potential and knew I had to move on.</p>
        <p>The first time the parallel between what I did and what I could do clicked was when I was organizing my many incoming emails with rules. I was making it very specialized, where ordering rules mattered and one small selection had many big effects. The thought process was a lot like symbolic logic I learned in college, but practically applied (I always thought symbolic logic was mostly useful for people taking the LSAT/law careers). My degree in Linguistics gave me an idea of what programming would be like, and though then it was just a small idea, I thought: “Huh. I can actually do this. And it can be just as practical as what I am doing now.”</p>          
        <p>So I did.</p>
